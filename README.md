# How to use
- In the upper corner of the program, you will find a field where you can enter a year to obtain the sales for that year (Seeding Year). Click on the Get button to show the data in the table below.
- Below the year field you will find a percentage field to enter the increase in total sales expected for the next year. This percentage can also be manually specified for each state, entering it in the corresponding cell in the table. There are two different buttons next to the percentage field: “Apply” and “Apply All”. “Apply” is used to apply the percentage to all states except the ones that have been manually modified. “Apply All” serves to reset all states to the same percentage.
